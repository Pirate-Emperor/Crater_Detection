# Crater_Detection

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Crater_Detection  
**Author:** Pirate-Emperor

## Description

Crater_Detection is a specialized repository developed by Pirate-Emperor that focuses on identifying and outlining impact craters on lunar surfaces. This project combines the outputs of various lunar models, including Lunar_ISR, Crater_Detection itself, Height_Map, DTM_3D, Slope, Shadow, and Hazard_Map, to create detailed crater maps. Accurate crater detection is crucial for lunar research, exploration, and mission planning.

## Models Integration

Crater_Detection integrates the following models to derive crater maps:

1. **Lunar_ISR:** Enhances the resolution of lunar images to provide clearer details.
2. **Crater_Detection:** Identifies and outlines impact craters on the lunar surface.
3. **Height_Map:** Generates high-resolution lunar height maps for accurate topographic information.
4. **DTM_3D:** Estimates the depth information of lunar terrain from 2D images.
5. **Slope:** Provides slope maps derived from the lunar terrain.
6. **Shadow:** Generates shadow maps based on lighting conditions and lunar features.
7. **Hazard_Map:** Combines the outputs of various models to create a comprehensive hazard map.
